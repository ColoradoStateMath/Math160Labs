%%BALL BEARINGS PROBLEM%%
\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textit{Ball Bearings}}}

You work for a company that manufactures ball bearings. Currently you are working on quality control for ball bearings with ball diameter measuring $10mm$. Now, in the real world, measurements are not perfect...
    %%Part 1a
    \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#1a:}}
    Calculate the ``perfect'' volume of one of these balls?
    $\answer[tolerance=0.000001]{4/3 \pi 5^3}$
    \end{problem}
    %%Part 1b
    \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#1b:}}
    An order has been placed by a skateboard company. They need ball bearings for some of the wheels they are manufacturing. For wheel assembly, the volume of each ball must be within $1.57mm^3$ of the perfect volume. With this tolerance in mind, what is the largest amount that the radius of each ball can vary from the perfect radius? (a percent SHOULD NOT be given here)
    $\answer[tolerance=0.000001]{(3/4((4/3 \pi 5^3)+1.57)/\pi)^(1/3)-5}$
    \end{problem}
    %%Part 1c
    \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#1c:}}
    You need to put together an order for an aerospace company. For this order there must be less variation in the volume. A variation of $\pm0.03mm^3$ will be tolerated in the volume. Based on this, what is the largest amount of error that the radius of a given ball can have? (a percent SHOULD NOT be given here)
    $\answer[tolerance=0.000001]{(3/4((4/3 \pi 5^3)+0.03)/\pi)^(1/3)-5}$    
    \end{problem}
\end{problem}

%%CRYSTAL GROWTH PROBLEM%%
\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textit{Crystal Growth}}}

A crystal growth furnace is used in research to determine how best to manufacture crystals used in electronic components for the space shuttle.  For proper growth of the crystal, the temperature must be controlled accurately by adjusting the input power.  Suppose the relationship is given by

\[T(w)= 0.1 w^2 +2.155 w +19.985
\]

where $T$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius and $w$ is the power input in watts.
    %%Part 2a
   \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#2a:}}
   How many watts of power are needed to maintain the temperature at exactly 200$^\circ$ C?
   $\answer[tolerance=0]{33}$
   \end{problem}
   
   %%Part 2b
   \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#2b:}}
   What interval around the ideal power found in (a) must the power be to keep the temperature within $\pm 1^\circ$C  of the 200$^\circ$C required for proper crystal growth? Be sure to use algebra to show that if the power is kept in this range, the temperature will, indeed, be within $\pm 1^\circ$C  of 200$^\circ$C.
   
   $\answer[tolerance=0.00001]{\sqrt{1790.15+(21.55/2)^2}-21.55/2} <w< \answer[tolerance=0.00001]{\sqrt{1810.15+(21.55/2)^2}-21.55/2}$
   
   \end{problem}
   
   %%Part 2c
   \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#2c:}}
   \textbf{Your answer to this question should be typed or written in a separate document and labeled as Problem 2c.}
   
   Sketch the graph of $T(w)$ on the interval $w\in[0,40]$. Make sure your graph is detailed.
   
%	\includegraphics[width=12cm, height=6cm]{Tolerance_crystals_axis2.png}
    \end{problem}
    
    %%Part2d
    \begin{problem}{\textbf{\#2d:}}
    \textbf{Your answer to this question should be typed or written in a separate document and labeled as Problem 2d. You can add to the document containing your graph from 2c.}
    
    \textbf{Label} interval of temperature ($T$-interval) that can be tolerated for proper crystal growth. Your label should be placed on the $T$-axis and should be titled ``$T$-Interval''
    
	\textbf{Label} the $w$-interval you found in part (b) for input power that corresponds to the given $T$-interval. Your label should be placed on the $w$-axis and should be titled ``$w$-Interval''
    \end{problem}
    
\end{problem}

%%PROBLEM 3%%
\begin{problem}{\textbf{\#3}}
\textbf{Your answer to this question should be typed or written in a separate document and labeled as Problem 3. You can add to the document containing your answers from problem 2.}

  For problems 1 and 2 you had to find an interval of input values that would satisfy an arbitrary interval of output values (if the word ``arbitrary'' is throwing you off, chat with your instructor). Can this be done for any function? If yes, explain why. If not, provide a graph or function of a counter example and explain why it is a counter example.
\end{problem}

%%PROBLEM 4 - cos (pi/x)%%
\begin{problem}{\textbf{\textit{An Investigation with tables. Be careful; tables can be misleading! }}}
Use $\displaystyle f(x)=\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)$ to fill in the following three tables.
Use the Desmos calculator widget below to compute your answers. Report any non-terminating values to 8 decimal places.
