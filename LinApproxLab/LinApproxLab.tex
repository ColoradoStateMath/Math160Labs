\section{Math 160 Lab 2 \\ Linear Approximation}

\begin{abstract}
We use a method called ``linear approximation'' to estimate the value
of (complicated) functions at a given point.

%\section{Linear approximation}

Given a function, a \textit{linear approximation} is a fancy phrase
for something you already know:
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The derivative is the slope of the tangent line.}
\end{quote}
%Except in this section, the emphasis is on the \textbf{line}.


\begin{definition}\index{linear approximation}
If $f$ is a differentiable function at $x=a$, then a \textbf{linear
  approximation} for $f$ at $x=a$ is given by
\[
\l(x) = f'(a)(x-a) +f(a).
\]
\end{definition}


Note that $\l(x)$ is just the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$.

\begin{example}
Below is the graph of $f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2$ and the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Feel free to explore how the tangent line changes as $a$ varies by using the slider.
\[
\graph[panel]{a=1, f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2, t(x) = f'(a)(x-a)+ f(a)}
\]
\end{example}

A linear approximation of $f$ is a ``good'' approximation as long as
$x$ is ``not too far'' from $a.$
%As we see from Figure~\ref{figure:informal-tangent}, 
If one ``zooms in'' on $f$ sufficiently, then $f$ and the linear
approximation are nearly indistinguishable. As a first example, we
will see how linear approximations allow us to make approximate
``difficult'' computations.



%% It maybe useful to compute an approximation using the cube root of 27 instead. Then students can see the difference between their approximations and which is better.
\begin{example}
Use a linear approximation of $f(x) =\sqrt[3]{x}$ at $x=64$ to
approximate $\sqrt[3]{50}$.
\begin{explanation}
To start, write
\[
\ddx f(x) = \ddx x^{1/3} = \frac{1}{\answer[given]{3x^{2/3}}}.
\]
So our linear approximation is
\begin{align*}
\l(x) &= \frac{1}{3\cdot 64^{2/3}} (x-64) + \answer[given]{4} \\
&= \frac{1}{\answer[given]{48}} (x-64) + 4\\
&= \answer[given]{1/48}x + \answer[given]{8/3}.
\end{align*}

Now let's use our approximation and true value to find our approximation's error.

Use the Desmos widget below to determine the error of your approximation for $\sqrt[3]{50}$, noting that $\sqrt[3]{50} = f(50)$.

\[
\graph[panel]{f(x) = x^{1/3}, l(x) = (1/48) x + (8/3)}
\]


The approximation is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{above}\choice{below}} the true 
answer by $\answer[tolerance=0.000001]{0.024302}$ units.

%Now we evaluate $\l(50) \approx 3.71$ and compare it to
%$\sqrt[3]{50}\approx 3.68$.  From this we see that the linear
%approximation, while perhaps inexact, is computationally \textbf{easier}
%than computing the cube root.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}


With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear
necessary to use linear approximations. In fact they are quite
useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they
allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a
``reality check'' on a more complex calculation. In some complex
calculations involving functions, the linear approximation makes an
otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of
accuracy.





\begin{example}%\label{exam:linear approximation of sine}
Use a linear approximation of $f(x) =\sin(x)$ at $x=0$ to approximate
$\sin(0.3)$.
\begin{explanation}
To start, write
\[
\ddx f(x) = \answer[given]{\cos(x)},
\]
so our linear approximation is
\begin{align*}
\l(x) &= \answer[given]{\cos(0)}\cdot(x-0) + 0\\
&= x.
\end{align*}

%\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=-1.6,xmax=1.6,ymin=-1.5,ymax=1.5,
            axis lines=center,
            xtick={-1.57, 0, 1.57},
            xticklabels={$-\pi/2$, $0$, $\pi/2$},
            ytick={-1,1},
            %ticks=none,
            %width=3in,
            %height=2in,

            xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]        
          \addplot [very thick, penColor, samples=100,smooth, domain=(-1.6:1.6)] {sin(deg(x))};
          \addplot [very thick, penColor2, samples=100,smooth] {x};
          \node at (axis cs:1,.6) [penColor] {$f$};
          \node at (axis cs:-1,-1.2) [penColor2] {$\l$};
          \addplot[color=penColor3,fill=penColor3,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(0,0)};  %% closed hole

\end{image}
Hence a linear approximation for $\sin(x)$ at $x=0$ is $\l(x) = x$,
and so $\l(0.3) = 0.3$.  Comparing this to $\sin(.3) \approx 0.295$,
we see that the approximation is quite good. For this reason, it is common
to approximate $\sin(x)$ with its linear approximation $\l(x) = x$
when $x$ is near zero.  
%see Figure~\ref{figure:la sin}.
