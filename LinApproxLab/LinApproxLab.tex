\section{Math 160 Lab 2 \\ Linear Approximation}

\begin{abstract}
This is Lab 2 for Math 160 - Due Wednesday, 12 October, 2016. This lab will cover tolerance and provide an introduction to the idea of limits. Unless stated otherwise, compute all values to $6$ decimal places.

We use a method called ``linear approximation'' to estimate the value of (complicated) functions at a given point.
\end{abstract}

\begin{example}
Suppose you want to approximate the function $f(x) = (x-2)^2  + 4$ at $x=3$.

Given a line with slope $m$ through the point $(a, b)$, what is the point-slope form of the line?
\[
y = \answer[given]{m(x - a) + b}
\]

What is the slope of the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=3$?
\[
\answer{2}
\]

\begin{problem}
What point should an approximation of $f(x)$ at $x=3$ go through?

\[
(\answer[given]{3}, \answer[given]{5})
\]
\begin{hint}
Should the linear approximation go through the point at which it is approximating?
\end{hint}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What is the equation of the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x-2$?
\[
y = \answer[given]{2}x + \answer[given]{-1}
\]
\begin{hint}
Have your answer in the form of $y=mx+b$.
\end{hint}

\begin{feedback}
Your line should look like this.
\[
\graph{f(x) = (x-2)^2+4, y = 2(x-3) + 5}
\]
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}




%\section{Linear approximation}

Given a function, a \textit{linear approximation} (at $x=x_0$) is a fancy phrase
for something you already know:
\begin{center}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The line tangent to the function (at $x=x_0$).}
\end{quote}
\end{center}
%Except in this section, the emphasis is on the \textbf{line}.


\begin{definition}\index{linear approximation}
If $f$ is a differentiable function at $x=a$, then a \textbf{linear
  approximation} for $f$ at $x=a$ is given by
\[
\l(x) = f'(a)(x-a) +f(a).
\]
\end{definition}


Note that $\l(x)$ is just the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$.


\begin{example}
Below is the graph of $f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2$ and the line
tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Feel free to explore how the tangent line
(in purple) changes as $a$ varies by using the slider. You may need to
hit `-' (zoom out) in order to see the linear approximations for large $a$ values.
\[
\graph[panel]{a=1, f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2, t(x) = f'(a)(x-a)+ f(a)}
\]

Notice how the linear approximation (the purple line) hugs
$f(x)$ (the green line) at the $x=a$ value!
\end{example}

A linear approximation of $f$ is a ``good'' approximation as long as
$x$ is ``not too far'' from $a$.
%As we see from Figure~\ref{figure:informal-tangent}, 
If one ``zooms in'' on $f$ at $x=a$ sufficiently, then $f$ and the linear
approximation are nearly indistinguishable. As a first example, we
will see how linear approximations allow us to make approximate
``difficult'' computations.
\end{example}




%%%%%% Aproximation of \sqrt[3]{50} number 1
\begin{example}
Use a linear approximation of $f(x) =\sqrt[3]{x}$ at $x=64$ to
approximate $\sqrt[3]{50}$.
\begin{explanation}
To start, write
\[
\ddx f(x) = \ddx x^{1/3} = \frac{1}{\answer[given]{3x^{2/3}}}.
\]
So our linear approximation is
\begin{align*}
\l(x) &= \frac{1}{3\cdot 64^{2/3}} (x-64) + \answer[given]{4} \\
&= \frac{1}{\answer[given]{48}} (x-64) + 4\\
&= \answer[given]{1/48}x + \answer[given]{8/3}.
\end{align*}

\begin{question}
Using the linear approximation just found (and the Desmos calculator below), 

\[
\sqrt[3]{50} \approx \answer[tolerance=0.000001]{3.70833333}.
\]
\begin{hint}
Remember to round to 6 decimal places.
\end{hint}
\end{question}

Now let's use our approximation and true value to find our approximation's error.


Use the Desmos widget below to determine the error of your approximation for $\sqrt[3]{50}$, noting that $\sqrt[3]{50} = f(50)$.

\[
\graph[panel]{f(x) = x^{1/3}, l(x) = (1/48) x + (8/3)}
\]

\begin{question}
The approximation is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{above}\choice{below}} the true 
answer by $\answer[tolerance=0.000001]{0.024302}$ units.

\begin{hint}
Note that $f(50)$ when plugged into Desmos will give $
sqrt[3]{50}$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
What will be $\l(50)$ give you in the Desmos calculator?
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
How can you use the Desmos calculator to find the difference of these two numbers?
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
What does $f(50)-\l(50)$ give you? Is that what you want?
\end{hint}
\end{question}
%Now we evaluate $\l(50) \approx 3.71$ and compare it to
%$\sqrt[3]{50}\approx 3.68$.  From this we see that the linear
%approximation, while perhaps inexact, is computationally \textbf{easier}
%than computing the cube root.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear
necessary to use linear approximations. In fact they are quite
useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they
allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a
``reality check'' on a more complex calculation. In some complex
calculations involving functions, the linear approximation makes an
otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of
accuracy.
