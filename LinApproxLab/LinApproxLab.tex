\section{Math 160 Lab 2 \\ Linear Approximation}

\begin{abstract}
This is Lab 2 for Math 160 - Due Wednesday, 12 October, 2016. This lab will cover tolerance and provide an introduction to the idea of limits. Unless stated otherwise, compute all values to $6$ decimal places.

We use a method called ``linear approximation'' to estimate the value of (complicated) functions at a given point.

\begin{example}
Suppose you want to approximate the function $f(x) = (x-2)^2  + 4$ at $x=3$.

Given a line with slope $m$ through the point $(a, b)$, what is the point-slope form of the line?
\[
y = \answer[given]{m(x - a) + b}
\]

What is the slope of the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=3$?
\[
\answer{2}
\]

\begin{problem}
What point should an approximation of $f(x)$ at $x=3$ go through?

\[
(\answer[given]{3}, \answer[given]{5})
\]
\begin{hint}
Should the linear approximation go through the point at which it is approximating?
\end{hint}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What is the equation of the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x-2$?
\[
y = \answer[given]{2}x + \answer[given]{-1}
\]
\begin{hint}
Think $y=mx+b$
\end{hint}

\begin{feedback}
Your line should look like this.
\[
\graph{f(x) = (x-2)^2+4, y = 2(x-3) + 5}
\]
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}




%\section{Linear approximation}
Given a function, a \textit{linear approximation} (at $x=x_0$) is a fancy phrase
for something you already know:
\begin{center}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The line tangent to the function (at $x=x_0$).}
\end{quote}
\end{center}


\begin{definition}\index{linear approximation}
If $f$ is a differentiable function at $x=a$, then a \textbf{linear
  approximation} for $f$ at $x=a$ is given by
\[
\l(x) = f'(a)(x-a) +f(a).
\]
\end{definition}


Note that $\l(x)$ is just the line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$.


\begin{example}
Below is the graph of $f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2$ and the line
tangent to $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Feel free to explore how the tangent line
(in purple) changes as $a$ varies by using the slider. You may need to
hit `-' (zoom out) in order to see the linear approximations for large $a$ values.
\[
\graph[panel]{a=1, f(x) = 1/8x^3 + (3/8)x^2 -3/4 - 2, t(x) = f'(a)(x-a)+ f(a)}
\]

Notice how the linear approximation (the purple line) hugs
$f(x)$ (the green line) at the $x=a$ value!
\end{example}

A linear approximation of $f$ is a ``good'' approximation as long as
$x$ is ``not too far'' from $a$.
If one ``zooms in'' on $f$ at $x=a$ sufficiently, then $f$ and the linear
approximation are nearly indistinguishable. As a first example, we
will see how linear approximations allow us to make approximate
``difficult'' computations.
\end{example}
